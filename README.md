this repo contains various dapps. 
Inside each of these dapp folders, there is a contract, javascript test, deploy script, and frontend file. 
The basic necessary files to run a dapp.
The purpose of this repo is to just help me get more familiar with the flow of the code and how the files work together.
As I am working to become a full stack dev, I am spending more time getting better at frontend integration with React.
Most of my experience is on the backend, writing contracts and tests, both in javascript and foundry.
As I progress, I want to be able to create sleek frontends that help represents my contracts.
